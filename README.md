# Containers Workshop

This repository includes assets for a hands-on workshop delivered to Microsoft Federal customers to help them learn about container technology and how to run their workloads on Azure. Recognizing that Microsoft Federal customers generally have stricter requirements regarding security of their workloads, the "happy path" often found in Azure documentation and quickstarts to get started with various services is often not sufficient. Here, we strive to reduce the friction experienced by our Federal customers, and the CSA's working with them, to quickly get up and running in Azure in a way that adheres to many of their security requirements

The assets in this repository are not intended to replace any Azure guidance or quickstarts, but instead, augment them to meet the unique needs of our Federal customers. Assets you may expect to find in this repository include:
